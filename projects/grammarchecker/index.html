    <h4>Story : Last weekend, I took literally the most beautifull bike ride of my life. The route is called<br> "The 9W to Nyack" and it stretches all the way from Riverside Park in Manhattan to South Nyack, New <br>Jersey. It's really an adventure from beginning to end! It is a 48 mile loop and it literally took me an <br>entire day. I stopped at Riverbank State Park to take some artsy photos. It was a short stop, though, <br>because I had a freaking long way to go. After a quick photo op at the very popular Little Red Lighthouse I <br>began my trek across the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey. The GW is a breathtaking 4,760 feet <br>long! I was already very tired by the time I got to the other side. An hour later, I reached Greenbrook <br>Nature Sanctuary, an extremely beautifull park along the coast of the Hudson. Something that was very <br>surprising to me was that near the end of the route you literally cross back into New York! At this point, <br>you are very close to the end.</h4>
